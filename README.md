# LEOPARD

## Project LEOPARD Description

Project LEOPARD is a CubeSat project developed by the University of Cincinnati CubeCats, a student-led organization designed to give students hands-on engineering experience with space systems. LEOPARD stands for Low Earth Orbit Project for Aerospace Research and Development.

LEOPARD is a research project to determine the efficacy of various materials of radiation mitigation in the space environment. It uses 8 RADFET radiation sensors shielded with carbon-carbon composites, polyethylene and carbon-carbon, or unshielded to determine the effect of these materials on radiation protection over time.

This repository is used for the main computing system of the satellite. It is includes all of the custom libraries used for the LEOPARD Arduino sketch.

## Main LEOPARD Repository

Before continuing, please read and follow the instructions on the README located in the main [LEOPARD repository](https://github.com/uccubecats/LEOPARD).

## Pull This Repo

This repo must be pulled into your root Arduino `libraries` directory. For Macs, this will likely be `/Users/$(AppleID)/Documents/Arduino/libraries`. For Windows, this would be `C:\Program Files (x86)\Arduino\libraries\`.

## Acknowledgements of Technologies and Softwares Used

Project LEOPARD uses many open-sourced technologies for its development. We have included and modified arduino libraries from the following repositories:
